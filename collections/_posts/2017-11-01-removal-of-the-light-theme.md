Since we are doing an overhaul of the website, we decided to remove the light theme.
<!--more-->

This is something that has been *considered multiple times* and considering it makes the addition of new features longer, we decided to end the life of the light theme today.

In fact, maintaining those two theme takes time and we don't see any reason to keep those two anymore. We do believe that the dark theme fits really well the ambiance (Blizzard would say the class fantasy!) of the website.
