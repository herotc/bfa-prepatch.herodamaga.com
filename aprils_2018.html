    <p>Dear friends of Hero Damage,</p>
    <p>We have decided to stop publishing simulation resources for World of Warcraft and focus on a different kind of Theorycrafting and research.
      Since we are all fans of the amazing strategy game Minesweeper, we will dedicate this site to all Theorycrafting related to the game.

          As we are removing those useless WoW resources we are preparing an amazing collection of Minesweeper rankings and statistics. It is our goal
          to give you everything you need in order to become one of the best competitive Minesweeper players. You want those Mythic Minesweep parses and
          your gray rankings and early explosions do not satisfy you? Then you have come to the right place.
